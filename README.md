# RTime series forecasting using LSTM
Here, I am using LSTM network to forecast future demand of 5 different servers. The datasets are given for around 9 months. I am taking first 6216 values of each server to predict the demand of next 30 hours and later comparing it with the actual data. We can use this model to predict as many hours in the future,but for the real case scenario we can see that after forecasting the demand, we have to forcely put some values to zero because some servers are offline during some days of the week. That can be done easily by Excel or python. But the main theme of this work is to show how LSTM network can be implemented to do time series forecasting.
